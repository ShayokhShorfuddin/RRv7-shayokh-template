# RRv7-shayokh-template
A starter template create by me for React Router v7 Framework mode.

### What's unique?
1. Includes biomejs for formatting.
2. Pre-configured folder-based route config.
3. Excludes a few unnecessary files and lines of codes which are usually not required.

### Get started.
Fire up your terminal and paste the following command -
```
npx create-react-router@latest <project-name> --template ShayokhShorfuddin/RRv7-shayokh-template
```
